*Linear Regression to Predict MPG*

•	The variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to mpg values are Vehicle length, vehicle weight and ground clearance

•	P value of 5.35e-11is much smaller than the significance level, the null hypothesis is rejected.  So, the slope of the linear model in not zero.

•	Since the R squared value is 0.6825 which is close to 0.7, the linear model will predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively
